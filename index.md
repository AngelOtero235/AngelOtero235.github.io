### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

     Lab 02, the first lab in which we were introduced to the first aspects of cloning, pushing changes back for grading 
and the use of a text editor to remove and improve from the mistakes that were made. This was an important lab to me 
because I was completely new to coding at that time, I didn't even know what to use to even start when coding. I did 
have difficulties understanding the start of this lab and had to ask for help countless times, but it was worth it because
after completing it, I realized I can actually do this and learn something I thought I couldn't learn. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 08, a very tough lab in my opinion, had many difficulties understanding it. I went to tutoring services most of 
the time because of it. Even though it was challenging and I barely finished the first part, tutors helped me understand 
some huge major parts of the code out; if(arguments.size() < 2) { that first lane helped me understand so much about 
coding, helped me understand that code can be given a non-number value for the .size and the computer will do the job 
for you to determine if it's smaller than the value, 2. 


* Lab 11

    Lab 11, it was an extremely challenging lab due to my slow and steady learning speed, though I learned something 
extremely important and boosted my morale in learning this without doubts. You can code however you want, there isn't 
a correct way to code, as long as it does its job efficiently, it is good enough and that's what I aim for. This is my 
favorite lab because it teaches me important aspects in coding and inspecting someone's else's code. It's pretty cool 
and interesting that it made me want my own unique style of coding.
